    <section>
        <p>As per the requirements of task, i need to go visit local businesses with the goal of finding out, if there are, any tools or software they have been using
            to ease their work.</p> 
            <p>I went to a <strong>Retailer</strong> just around the corner. At first glance i didn't see any new technology being used. 
              So i simply asked if he wished to have any retail based software in his shop. To which he replied, he'd love to have Point of Sale (POS), like that of a big supermarket. POS is 
               a system that allows one's business to accept payments for customers and keep track of sales and also very useful for keep record of inventory.
               But him being a small town retailer, and with not so high customer flow, it could be rendered superflous.

            And then i saw a QR code pamplet. It is for an online payment system developed by company named <strong>"Khalti".</strong></p>
            
            <a href="https://khalti.com/"><h2>Khalti</h2></a>
            <ul>
                <li>Khalti along with other payement gateway have taken Nepalese market by storm.</li>
                <li>It has made easier for us to pay for range of services like basic utility payment, travel and ticketing, movies, and even tax payment, and so on.</li>
                <li>They offer payment services through hundreds of merchant spread across the country and provide really easy and hassle free payments using ebanking,smart banking, cards and wallets.</li>
                <li>I have come to know, Khalti has over 8000 POS(Point of Sale) and Agent Network providing its services to the users.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>On the same day, i also went to a finance near to my house, namely Pathivara Finance, to know what softwares they are using for their day to day operation.
                They seem to be really hesitant on disclosing the information, telling me its not too company policy friendly for them. Yet i still somehow got to know their accounting software name.
                 It's name <a href="https://rigonepal.com/index.html">RIGO.</a> Other than that i saw a biometric attendance machine on a wall in the entrance.
